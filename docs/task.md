# Task

A **task** represents **the code executed by a node in the data flow graph**. In 
other languages, a **task** can be referred to as a *job* or a *filter*. 
A task is defined by its input and output data and the code to execute when 
triggered. In other words, a task comes with a set of data called 
[sockets](socket.md) (not to be confused with network and system sockets). The 
sockets model the data that are consumed (input socket) and produced (output 
socket) by the current task. Finally, the code to execute is stored in a 
so-called *codelet*.

A task is a C++ object of the `aff3ct::runtime::Task` class. The following
sections try to give an overview of the most important attributes and methods
to facilitate the code understanding.

## Main Attributes

```cpp
std::vector<std::shared_ptr<runtime::Socket>> sockets;
```
The list of sockets that are attached to this task.

```cpp
std::vector<std::vector<uint8_t>> out_buffers;
```
The allocated data of the output sockets of this task. If the `autoalloc` 
attribute is set to `true` (see below) then the data are allocated here, 
otherwise this vector is left empty.

```cpp
std::function<int(module::Module &m, runtime::Task& t, const size_t frame_id)> codelet;
```
The function called by `_exec()` method (see below), thus dictating the 
task's behavior. Usually set in the [module](module.md)'s constructor and should 
return a `status_t`.

```cpp
std::shared_ptr<runtime::Socket> fake_input_sockets;
```
Fake input sockets are used when specifying dependencies between tasks
directly. Thus, internally, these dependencies are managed through "fake input
sockets" that are created on-the-fly over the current task. The data of these
sockets are ignored during the codelet execution.

```cpp
bool autoalloc;
```
If set to `true`, let `AFF3CT-core` allocate and reallocate memory needed by 
the task. Data are only allocated in the output sockets. By default this 
attribute is set to `true`.

```cpp
bool stats;
```
If `true`, records statistics regarding the task's execution, such as the 
`duration`. By default this attribute is set to `false`.

```cpp
bool fast;
```
If `true`, skips `can_exec()` runtime check, thus, improving performance. 
Sockets bound to this task will also be set to `fast`. By default this 
attribute is set to `false`.

```cpp
bool debug;
```
If set to true, displays the task's sockets data and its status upon 
execution (on the standard output). By default this attribute is set to 
`false`.

```cpp
module::Module *module;
```
A pointer to the corresponding module. See the [Module](module.md) section for 
more information about what is a module.

```cpp
const std::string name;
```
A name to identify the task. This name is unique in the module.

## Main Methods

```cpp
const std::vector<int>& exec(const int frame_id = -1, const bool managed_memory = true);
```
Calls `_exec()` method, records execution statistics (if `stats == true`) and 
prints the debug logs (if `debug == true`).

```cpp
void _exec(const int frame_id = -1, const bool managed_memory = true);
```
Executes the task's `codelet` and sets the `status` for this specific call.
Called by `exec()` (see the above method).

```cpp
bool can_exec() const;
```
Returns `true` if all the sockets are associated to an allocated buffer, 
otherwise returns `false`. Called by `exec()` method if `fast` is set to 
`false`, skipped otherwise.

```cpp
void bind(runtime::Task &t_out, const int priority = -1);
```
Add a fake input socket to the current task (see above `fake_input_sockets` 
attribute) and binds it to the output `status` socket of the `t_out` task in 
parameter. The new socket's `datatype` and `databytes` match the output 
`status` socket of `t_out`. `fake_input_sockets` is always `fast`. This 
method has to be manually called by the user.

```cpp
size_t unbind(runtime::Task &t_out);
```
Unbinds and deletes the corresponding input socket in the 
`fake_input_sockets` attribute. Can be called by `Sequence::set_n_frames()` 
or manually by the user.

```cpp
void reset();
```
Resets the task's statistics. Not to be confused with `Module::reset()`.
Manually called by the user.
