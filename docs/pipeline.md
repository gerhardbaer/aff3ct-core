# Pipeline

A **pipeline** is a feature offered by `AFF3CT-core` allowing to split a
[sequence](sequence.md) into multiple [stages](#Stage). Each stage is executed 
on one or more threads in parallel. The pipeline takes care of the 
**synchronizations between stages**. This is achieved through an implementation 
of **a producer/consumer algorithm**.

A pipeline is a C++ object of the `aff3ct::runtime::Pipeline` class. The 
following sections try to give an overview of the most important attributes and 
methods to facilitate the code understanding.

## Main Attributes

```cpp 
runtime::Sequence original_sequence;
``` 
The original sequence from which the pipeline was created.

<a name="Stage"></a>
```cpp 
std::vector<std::shared_ptr<runtime::Sequence>> stages;
``` 
Vector of the different stages in the pipeline. Each stage is a
[sequence](sequence.md).

```cpp
std::vector<std::pair<std::tuple<runtime::Socket*, size_t, size_t, size_t,size_t>,
            std::tuple<runtime::Socket*, size_t, size_t, size_t>>> sck_orphan_binds;
```
Vector of [sockets](socket.md) with broken connections due to the pipeline
stages creation (hence "orphan"). These sockets will be bound later to special
modules called [adaptors](#Adaptor) to make "bridges" between the stages.

```cpp
std::vector<std::tuple<runtime::Socket*, runtime::Socket*, size_t>> adaptors_binds;
```
Vector of tuple (`input`, `output`, `priority`) of the created adaptors, 
`priority` is used to order the tuples.

## Main Methods

```cpp
void exec();
```
This is the public method that runs the pipeline in loop. Other variants exist
where it is possible to give a stop condition function.

```cpp
void init(const std::vector<runtime::Task*> &firsts,
          const std::vector<runtime::Task*> &lasts,
          const std::vector<std::tuple<std::vector<runtime::Task*>, std::vector<runtime::Task*>, std::vector<runtime::Task*>>> &sep_stages = {},
          const std::vector<size_t> &n_threads = {},
          const std::vector<size_t> &synchro_buffer_sizes = {},
          const std::vector<bool> &synchro_active_waiting = {},
          const std::vector<bool> &thread_pinning = {},
          const std::vector<std::vector<size_t>> &puids = {});
```

This method creates the pipeline given:

- The first and last tasks of the original sequence (`firsts` and `lasts`).
- The first and last tasks of each stage (`sep_stages`).
- The number of threads to allocate to each stage (`n_threads`).
- The number of buffers between stages (`synchro_buffer_sizes`).
- The type of waiting for the adaptor tasks (`synchro_active_waiting`).

!!! note
	AFF3CT doesn't support consecutive multi-threaded stages yet.

```cpp
void create_adaptors(const std::vector<size_t> &synchro_buffer_sizes = {},
                     const std::vector<bool> &synchro_active_waiting = {});
```
This function creates the Adaptor modules (and so the `pull` & `push` tasks) 
that are added between each stage to transmit data from the stage $S$ to the 
stage $S+1$. 

```cpp
void _bind_adaptors(const bool bind_adaptors = true);
```
Adaptor module tasks `pull` & `push` need to be bound to each task in the two
consecutive stages, the target sockets to bind are stored in the vector
`sck_orphan_binds.`

<a name="Adaptor"></a>
## Adaptor

`aff3ct::module::Adaptor` is a special module automatically inserted between 
stages when creating a pipeline and serve as "bridges" between them, they are 
bound to first and last tasks of the consecutive stages. The purpose of adaptors 
is to synchronize data exchange between each stage using pre-allocated buffer 
pools. In other words, this is **an implementation of the producer-consumer 
algorithm**. There are 4 tasks performed by adaptors:

- `push_1`: when the $S$ stage is executed on one thread and the $(S+1)$ stage 
  is executed on multiple threads. The function gets an empty buffer and fills 
  it with the data produced in the stage $S$. The buffers are filled using a 
  round-robin algorithm.
- `pull_n`: when the $S$ stage is executed on multiple threads and the $(S-1)$
  stage is on one thread. It is the task executed just after the `push_1`, it
  takes a filled buffer from the inter-stage pool and forwards the data. There 
  is a `pull_n` task for every thread of the stage.
- `push_n`: when the $S$ stage is executed on multiple threads and the $(S+1)$
  stage is on one thread. The task takes an empty buffer from the pool and fills
  it with the data produced by the thread. There is a `push_n` task for each
  thread of the stage.
- `pull_1`: when the $S$ stage is executed on one thread and the $(S-1)$ stage 
  is on multiple threads, it's the task executed just after the `push_n`. It 
  takes filled buffers from the pool using the same round-robin algorithm as 
  `push_1` and forward the data.

### Main Attributes

```cpp
const size_t buffer_size;
```
The inter-stage buffer pool size.

```cpp
std::shared_ptr<std::vector<std::vector<std::vector<int8_t*>>>> buffer;
```
Pointers to each buffer of the inter-stage pool.

``` cpp
std::shared_ptr<std::vector<std::atomic<uint64_t>>> first;
std::shared_ptr<std::vector<std::atomic<uint64_t>>> last;
```
Two pointers used to monitor the buffer pool, `first` is used to get the filled
buffers, and `last` for the empty ones.

### Main Methods

These are the methods used to synchronize the buffer pool between the pipeline
stages. When getting a buffer, **the thread may sleep** if there is no empty 
buffer available. When a **new empty buffer** will be available, the sleeping 
thread will be **woken up**.

```cpp
void* get_empty_buffer(const size_t sid);
```
Get a pointer to the first empty buffer in the pool (at index `last`).

```cpp
void* get_filled_buffer(const size_t sid);
```
Get a pointer to the first filled buffer in the pool (at index `first`).

```cpp
void* get_empty_buffer(const size_t sid, void* swap_buffer);
```
Get a pointer to the first empty buffer in the pool, and replace this buffer
with a new one pointed by `swap_buffer` parameter. 

```cpp
void* get_filled_buffer(const size_t sid, void* swap_buffer);
```
Get a pointer to the first filled  buffer in the pool, and replace this buffer
with a new one pointed by `swap_buffer` parameter.

```cpp
void wake_up_pusher();
```
The puller can wake up a push task if this one is waiting for an empty buffer.

```cpp
void wake_up_puller();
```
The pusher can wake up a pull task if this one is waiting for an empty buffer.
