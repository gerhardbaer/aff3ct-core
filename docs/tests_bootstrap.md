# Bootstrap

`AFF3CT-core` comes with simple tests to validate its behavior. The later are
always a good way to bootstrap when you want to write your first code with the
DSEL. The source codes of the following tests are located in the 
`tests/bootstrap` folder. Each file corresponds to an executable test.

## Simple Chains

At some point we have to start somewhere :-). The following graphs are a very 
simple chains made from `increment`/`incrementf` tasks that simply perform 
"$+1$" on the data. Each time there are 6 `Incrementer` ($t_{[2:7]}$) so the 
final expected values in the `Finalizer` ($t_8$) are equal to the values from 
the `Initializer` ($t_1$) "$+6$".

=== "With Input and Output Sockets"

      ![Simple sequence](./assets/test_simple_chain.svg){ width="1000" }

    ```bash
    ./bin/test-simple-chain -t 1
    ```  
    This version of the simple chain is based on `increment` tasks that have one
    input socket and one output socket.

    **Command Line Arguments**

    The following verbatim is a copy-paste from the `-h` stdout:

## Looping

The looping tests are here to introduce and to validate how to implement simple
control flow. Each of the graph below execute one or multiple loops and in the
innermost loop 6 `increment` tasks are executed. `Switcher` modules are used to 
create two different paths, one for the loop and the other for the exit (the 
`Finalizer` task here). The output socket of the `iterate` task (from the 
`Iterator`  module) is bound to the input socket 1 of the `commute` task. The 
`iterate` task controls if the commute should execute the 6 `increment` tasks or 
the end the stream by executing the `finalize` task.

Each time there are 6 `Incrementer` in the innermost loop so the final expected 
values in the `Finalizer` are equal to the values from the `Initializer` ($t_1$) 
"$+(i \times j\times 6)$" ($j = 1$ in the `for` loop and `do-while` loop 
examples). 

=== "`For` Loop"

    <figure markdown>
      ![Simple sequence](./assets/test_for_loop.svg){ width="1000" }
    </figure>
    ```bash
    ./bin/test-for-loop -t 1 -i 10
    ```
    This test implements a classic `for-loop` where the condition is evaluated
    first in $t_3$ (a basic loop counter) and the the body of the loop is 
    executed ($t_{[5:10]}$) after. Note that this `for-loop` example can easily
    be extended to a more generic `while-loop` if the $t_3$ task is replaced 
    by an other task that depends on an input data socket. 

    In the command line, `-i 10` indicates that the loop is repeated 10 times.

    **Command Line Arguments**

    ```bash

    </figure>
    ```bash

    ```
    An implementation of a `do-while` loop where the condition $t_9$ is 
    evaluated after the body of the loop ($t_{[3:8]}$).

## Switch-case

The following test implements a `switch-case` pattern based on `increment` 
tasks ($t_{[4;9]}$). Depending on the `control` task ($t_2$), one of the three 
different paths (or cases in the `switch-case` pattern) will be executed. The 
first path (or `case 0`) is composed by $t_4$, $t_5$ and $t_6$ tasks, the second 
path (or `case 1`) is composed by $t_7$ and $t_8$ tasks while the 
third path (or `case 2`) is only composed by the $t_9$ task.

The final expected values in the `Finalizer` depends on the selected path. If 
the first path is chosen ($t_{[4:6]}$), "$+3$" is added to the values from the 
`Initializer` ($t_1$). If the second path is chosen ($t_{[7:8]}$), "$+2$" is 
added to the values from the `Initializer` ($t_1$). Finally, if the last path is 
chosen ($t_{9}$), "$+1$" is added to the values from the `Initializer` ($t_1$).

<figure markdown>
  ![Simple sequence](./assets/test_exclusive_paths.svg){ width="1000" }
</figure>

```bash
./bin/test-exclusive-paths -t 1 -y
```

The `-y` option indicates that the `Controller` is cyclic: for the first stream
the first path is selected, for the second stream the second path is taken, for
the third stream the third path is taken, for the fourth stream the first path
is taken and so on...

It is also possible to have a fixed path for all the streams with the `-a N` 
option (with `N` the path id).

!!! note
    You cannot use `-y` and `-a` parameters at the same time, they are 
    exclusive.

**Command Line Arguments**

The following verbatim is a copy-paste from the `-h` stdout:

```bash
usage: ./bin/test-exclusive-paths [options]

  -t, --n-threads       Number of threads to run in parallel                                  [10]

## Simple Pipeline

This test is an implementation of a 3 stages pipeline. The first stage 
$S1 = t_1$ reads data from a file. Thus, the `generate` task ($t_1$) is 
intrinsically sequential (= executes on a single thread). The second stage 
$S2 = t_{[2:7]}$ just copies the data from the stage $S_1$ through `relay` 
tasks. The `relay` tasks can be replicated and ran over multiple threads. 
Finally, the last stage $S3 = t_8$ is a `Sink` that writes the data on the 
file system. This operation is also intrinsically sequential.

The purpose of this test is to validate that buffer exchanges between the 
pipeline stages are working well. At the end, the code checks that the input 
file and the output file are the same.

<figure markdown>
  ![Simple sequence](./assets/test_simple_pipeline.svg){ width="1000" }
</figure>

```bash
./bin/test-simple-pipeline -t 3 --in-filepath ~/.bashrc --out-filepath output_file
```

!!! note
    The second output socket of the `generate` task ($t_1$) is bound to the
    second input socket of the `send_count` task ($t_8$). If the read data is 
    not a multiple of the stream size, then the stream is padded with 0. But,
    these zeros are NOT written on the file system by the `send_count` task.
    The second output socket of the `generate` task ($t_1$) contains the number
    of bits that have been read from the input file. Then, the `send_count` task
    can avoid to write the padding zeros (if any).
