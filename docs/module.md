# Module

A **module** is a container of [tasks](task.md). It contains the tasks 
themselves and their *inner data*. Inner data can be useful to avoid useless 
buffers re-allocations each time a task is executed, or a to contain a state 
that is updated each time a task is triggered.  Multiple **tasks can be grouped 
into one module** and can share data through the common module (as opposed to 
the use of [sockets](socket.md)). By definition,

- a **stateless task** is a task that does not have any inner data 
   (see `module::Stateless` class),
- a **stateful task** is a task that have inner data and, thus, a task that 
  need to be part of a module. 

Each time we need to create a **stateful** task, we will create a new C++ class 
that inherit from the `aff3ct::module::Module` class. The `Module` class 
provides `protected` methods to create new tasks and `public` methods to 
manipulate the module instances.

## Main Attributes

```cpp
std::vector<std::shared_ptr<runtime::Task>> tasks;
```
The tasks list of the current module. All the tasks in the vector are 
allocated (no `nullptr`).

```cpp
std::vector<std::shared_ptr<runtime::Task>> tasks_with_nullptr;
```
The tasks list of the current module where the tasks have a fixed position in
the vector. This is useful when a task is conditionally created. In the case
of a task that is not created in the current module, its value is set to 
`nullptr`.

```cpp
size_t n_frames;
```
Number of frames/streams to process each time a task is executed. For 
instance, if `n_frames == 2`, all the tasks of the current module will 
process 2 frames each time they are triggered.

```cpp
std::string name;
```
Name of the Module. This name is the same for all the instances of one class.

```cpp
std::string short_name;
```
Short name of the Module. This name is the same for all the instances of one 
class.

```cpp
std::string custom_name;
```
Custom name of the Module. This name can be redefined by the user for each 
instance.

## Main Protected Methods

```cpp
void set_name(const std::string &name);
```
Sets the module name.

```cpp
void set_short_name(const std::string &short_name);
```
Sets the module short name.

```cpp
runtime::Task& create_task(const std::string &name, const int id = -1);
```
Creates a new task, two tasks cannot share the same `name`.

```cpp
template <typename T>
size_t create_socket_in(runtime::Task& task, const std::string &name, const size_t n_elmts);
```
Creates an input socket over a given task.

```cpp
template <typename T>
size_t create_socket_out(runtime::Task& task, const std::string &name, const size_t n_elmts);
```
Creates an output socket over a given task.

```cpp
template <typename T>
size_t create_socket_fwd(runtime::Task& task, const std::string &name, const size_t n_elmts);
```
Creates a forward socket over a given task.

```cpp
void create_codelet(runtime::Task& task, std::function<int(module::Module &m, runtime::Task &t, onst size_t frame_id)> codelet);
```
Creates the codelet of the given task.

## Main Public Methods

```cpp
size_t get_n_frames() const;
```
Returns the number of frames to process in this Module.

```cpp
void set_n_frames(const size_t n_frames);
```
Sets the number of frames to process each time a task is executed.

```cpp
const std::string& get_name() const;
```
Returns the module name.

```cpp
const std::string& get_short_name() const;
```
Returns the module short name.

```cpp
void set_custom_name(const std::string &custom_name);
```
Sets the module custom name (each instance can have a different custom name).

```cpp
const std::string& get_custom_name() const;
```
Gets the custom name.

```cpp
runtime::Socket& operator[](const std::string &tsk_sck);
```
Returns the socket if it exists. The expected string format is 
`"task_name::socket_name"`.

```cpp
runtime::Task& operator()(const std::string &tsk_name);
```
Returns the task if it exists. The input string has to match an existing task 
name in this module.
